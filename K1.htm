                <p>
                    For an additional fee, Prime Visa offers special on-the-ground service assistance (pick-up and drop-off, and vice versa) wherein clients will be assisted during their visa-related activities in Manila for the client’s convenience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the point of the client’s arrival (airport or bus terminal), and for those residing within Metro Manila, the client will be picked up at the residential area and will be transported to the destination as required:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hotel Accommodation</li>
                    <li>Medical Facility (SLEC)</li>
                    <li>US Embassy</li>
                    <li>Commission on Filipino Overseas (drop off only)</li>
                    <li>National Bureau of Investigation (NBI)</li>
                    <li>Bureau of Immigration (BOI)</li>
                    <li>Philippine Retirement Authority (PRA)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    When the client has completed the activity (after drop-off), pick-up will be within 30 minutes. Should the company car is not available, the Grab car service will be used to send the client to the following destination (within Metro Manila):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Residence</li>
                    <li>Airport</li>
                    <li>US Embassy</li>
                    <li>Bus Terminal</li>
                    <li>Hotel Accommodation</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Should the client be found with special medical attention at SLEC (i.e. Sputum Test, Igra Test, Psychological Evaluation), the prime care assistant’s pick-up point and drop-off after SLEC will be at the following locations in Metro Manila, (pick up within 30 minutes after the activity applies):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Residence</li>
                    <li>Airport</li>
                    <li>US Embassy</li>
                    <li>Bus Terminal</li>
                    <li>Hotel Accommodation</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The Prime Visa will ensure that you will have a smooth and worry-free embassy interview day! An Interview Assistant will be standing by with you at the embassy premises carrying your gadgets and your important documents (in duplicates) to make sure that everything that the consul may require can be easily addressed.

            <div class="faqs__text">
                <ol>
                    <li><span>What is the approval rate, and how Prime Visa can help?</span></li>
                    <p>US Visa Prime consists of immigration consultants with expertise for over a decade. We offer a wide range of visa services with an approval rate of 99%. Entrust your visa application with us for a personalized immigration service, and we will guide you every step of the way, from start to finish, to minimize your chances of visa rejection and for greater peace of mind.</p>
                    
                    <li><span>I am a Green Card holder. Can I apply for a K1 Visa?</span></li>
                    <p>The sponsoring fiancé must be a U.S. citizen. A U.S. lawful permanent resident (a green card holder) cannot sponsor their fiancé for a K1 Visa. Each partner must be unmarried, and as evidence, the couple must submit any previous divorce decrees, annulments, or death certificates of a deceased spouse.</p>
                    
                    <li><span>What is RFE?</span></li>
                    <p>RFE is a Request for Evidence or simply a request for more documentation. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will send you an RFE on your application if it needs more information to finish processing the submitted application. For example, if you are applying for a green card, you must provide enough evidence to prove you are eligible, and USCIS will probably send you an RFE.</p>
                    
                    <li><span>Can I have my fiancé’s visa interview in Cebu, Philippines?</span></li>
                    <p>The U.S. Embassy in Manila holds interviews for all visa types.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. Consular Agency in Cebu provides passport and citizenship services by appointment only to U.S. citizens in the Visayas region and nearby provinces. They also provide emergency assistance to Americans in the Visayas region in cases of death, arrest, missing persons, and welfare concerns. They also offer limited notarial services for certain types of documents only.</p>

                    <li><span>Does the K1 Visa grant an immigration status and entitle the Filipino fiancé(e) to a green card?</span></li>
                    <p>The K-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows the holder to stay in the United States temporarily.</p>
                    <p>To successfully change the status from K-1 visa holder to Lawful Permanent Resident, an Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjustment of Status (AOS) is necessary by filing Form I-485, including various supporting documents.</p>

                    <li><span>Can I use my K1 visa to travel in and out of the United States?</span></li>
                    <p>The K-1 visa is a single visa entry that allows entry to the United States only once. If you leave the United States using the K-1 visa, be aware that re-entry is not permitted on the same visa status.</p>
                    
                    <li><span>What should a Filipino fiancé do upon entering the US on a K1 visa?</span></li>
                    <p>The K-1 visa permits the foreign-citizen fiancé(e) to travel to the United States and marry his/her U.S. citizen sponsor within 90 days of arrival.</p>
                    
                    <li><span>Can I work in the United States on a K1 Visa?</span></li>
                    <p>For you to work in the United States, an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) is required by filing Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization). EAD is an identity card that proves that you are allowed to work within a specific time frame in the US (valid for 90 days starting from the day you arrive in the US).</p>
            
                    <li><span>What are the common reasons for the denial of an immigration application?</span></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Incomplete or Incorrect Information</li>
                        <p>It is best to double-check all your details and provide accurate and complete information to move to the next step. Incorrect or missing information may result in visa denial.</p>
                    
                        <li>Inconsistencies in Your Application</li>
                        <p>The details of the information you provide in the application form and/or you provide during your embassy interview should be consistent and coincide with each other. Instability of your information may lead to visa denial.</p>
                    
                        <li>Providing false information</li>
                        <p>It is expected that the information you provide is truthful and accurate. False information can lead to visa denial and affect your ability to obtain visas in the future.</p>

                        <li>Insufficient Financial Proof</li>
                        <p>Proof of sufficient finances to cover your trip is required (i.e., bank statements, employment contracts, or tax returns). This is to prove to authorities that you will not carry out illegal work or become a burden to the government. If you cannot provide evidence of sufficient funds when it’s a mandatory requirement for the visa you’re requesting, your visa could be rejected due to the missing paperwork.</p>

                        <li>Passport Validity</li>
                        <p>Passport validity for most countries requires it to be valid for at least six months. It ensures a valid travel document during your stay and covers additional time for unforeseen events.</p>
                        <p>Your visa application can only be accepted if your passport has enough validity. If your passport expires while you are still in the country, legal complications may arise, and the host country might have to deal with your overstay.</p>

                        <li>Inadequate Supporting Documents</li>
                        <p>Applying for a visa requires a variety of supporting documents. These include documents that prove your identity, travel plans, financial resources, ties to your home country, and more.</p>
                        <p>The visa officer may not have enough information to make a favorable decision if you fail to provide adequate information and deny your application.</p>

                        <li>Lack of Clarity of Your Travel Purpose</li>
                        <p>The purpose of your travel is essential when you are applying for a visa. The reason could be tourism, study, business, work, etc. Being transparent with your travel purpose corresponds with specific requirements and restrictions. Failure to provide clarity of your travel purpose might result in visa rejection.</p>

                        <li>Previous Immigration Violations</li>
                        <p>When you apply for a visa, immigration authorities will look at your travel history. Past immigration violations such as overstaying a visa, working illegally, or entering a country illegally could lead to your visa denial.</p>

                        <li>Criminal Record</li>
                        <p>When you apply for a visa and have a criminal record, this could be a red flag to the authorities as their primary concern is the safety and security of their citizens, and could indicate that you pose a potential risk to the host country.</p>
                        <p>Each country has its specific policies and regulations. Some may deny visas on certain types of criminal records, and some might deny visas if the criminal activity was recent or if the crime was severe.</p>
                    
                    
                        <li>Insufficient Time for Processing</li>
                        <p>The processing of a visa varies depending on the country, the specific visa type, the time of the year, and individual circumstances. Once you submit your application, the visa officer will review the submitted application, and you might be called for an interview or asked to submit additional documents.
                            If your application for a visa is too close to your intended travel date, the embassy or consulate may not have sufficient time to complete the visa processing. While this might not result in a formal rejection of your visa, it does mean your visa might not be ready in time for your trip. In practical terms, it is as if your application was denied.</p>
                    
                        <li>Tips to Avoid Visa Denial</li>

                            <li>Complete the application form accurately and honestly.</li>
                            <li>Gather necessary documents.</li>
                            <li>Respect the purpose of your visa.</li>

                    </ul>


                    <li><span>Can my fiancé(e) enter the US with a tourist visa and then marry me to adjust her status to legal?</span></li>
                    <p>Coming to the US on a visitor visa with the sole intention of getting married in the US and then filing for adjustment of status is deemed to be visa fraud. US immigration officers do not take kindly to anyone they perceive has committed visa fraud.</p>
                
                    <li><span>Can I reapply or file an appeal if my application is denied?</span></li>
                    <p>There is no appeal process. After your visa denial, and (if there is) additional information and changes in your circumstances that need to be considered regarding the visa decision, you may reapply and submit the new visa application with the corresponding fee again.</p>
                
                    <li><span>Can I join my Filipino fiancé in her Embassy interview?</span></li>
                    <p>Unless the applicant is a minor or in need of physical assistance for an obvious medical ailment and/or is unable to communicate in any language spoken by the Embassy staff without a certified interpreter, no one may accompany the applicant on the scheduled visa interview.</p>
                
                    <li><span>How many children can I count as a derivative in my K1 fiancé visa?</span></li>
                    <p>A “derivative” visa applicant is the minor unmarried child (younger than age 21) of the beneficiary of an immigrant petition. Derivative family members can apply for immigrant visas with the beneficiary, who is considered the “principal” applicant.</p>
                    <p>If you receive a K-1 fiancé visa to enter the U.S. and get married to a U.S. citizen, your unmarried children under the age of 21, whether or not they are the biological children of your U.S. citizen fiancé, might be eligible to accompany you. They will be given "K-2" visas for U.S. entry. The term "children" includes not only natural children but adopted children and any born out of wedlock if your home country legally recognizes them as yours.</p>
                    
                    <li><span>Are government fees refundable if I am denied?</span></li>
                    <p>The government fee for your visa application is non-refundable. The price you have paid was meant to be processed and for a decision to be made, regardless of the decision itself.</p>

                    <li><span>Will I need a lawyer to file my K1/CR1 applications?</span></li>
                    <p>The law does not require that you use the service of a lawyer to complete the K1 /CR1 petition documents such as Form I-129F / I-130F. You can file USCIS forms yourself, but many prefer professional help.</p>

                    <li><span>Can I apply for a K1 Visa directly to the U.S. Embassy?</span></li>
                    <p>The needed Form I-129F cannot be filed at a U.S. Embassy, Consulate, or USCIS office abroad. After the petition approval from USCIS, it will be sent to the National Visa Center (NVC). The NVC will give you a case number and send your petition to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate where your fiancé(e) resides.</p>
